### This module takes you from WordPress beginner or intermediate admin user and puts you on the path to becoming a theme developer. You'll learn to create the exact look and functionality your project requires.
---
WordPress has become such a common tool that employers now expect job seekers to already know it just as they expect people to know popular tools from Microsoft, Adobe and Google. Ironically, it's less of a big deal that you know WordPress than it is if you don't know it. It's pretty fundamental now and good to get under your belt.

This is the third of three modules in a sequence of technical topics in the interactive curriculum. You will learn enough code to master the WordPress admin, manipulate core features and customize WordPress themes. We will build templates and themes using PHP, CSS, HTML and the WordPress API in four sessions. The fifth and final session will consist of a wrap up quiz as well as your brief presentations about what you customized with your own site.

## Course Goals
1. Transform a theme from its default look into a completely different looking, totally customized version.
2. Tweak WordPress templates using PHP and CSS to meet exact vision and specifications.
3. Learn the basics of PHP, the coding language for WordPress.
4. Build WordPress Child Themes.
5. Know how and where to find solutions to WordPress coding issues online.
